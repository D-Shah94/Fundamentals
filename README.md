Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organises code into objects, which are instances of classes. 
Here are some key concepts to understand:

- Class: A blueprint that defines the structure and behaviour of objects.
- Object: An instance of a class that represents a specific entity.
- Getters and Setters: Methods used to access (get) or modify (set) the values of object properties (fields).
- Methods: Functions defined within a class that perform specific tasks.
- Constructors: Special methods used to initialise objects of a class.
- Fields: Variables defined within a class that hold the state or data of an object.
- Equality (`==`) vs. Equals (`equals()`): The `==` operator checks if two object references point to the same memory location, while the `equals()` method compares the content or value of two objects.
