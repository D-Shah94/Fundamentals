// make objects immutable so they don't change, do this as much as you can
// public, protected, default, private, package levels, - access  - READ UP ON THIS!!!
// javac fundamentals/*.java
// static -  this method is not specific to any particular instance of person, it is a method on the class
// create a static method for class Person
// Add an extra case to the equals method - e.g. line 25, is this object
// == - compares references, equals method - compares values. (down to the individual engineer to implement this)
// primitives
// !!!!DO THIS!!! - Change the equals method implemention so that this -> System.out.println(person1.equals(new Person(null, 29)));
// gives the correct result

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "String.equals(Object)" because "<parameter1>.name" is null
	at fundamentals.Person.equals(Person.java:33)
	at fundamentals.HelloWorld.main(HelloWorld.java:28)
implemented a custom equals method
need to custom hashCode method - (both are overriden if one is overriden) - if the equals method returns true then the hashCode should also be the same
!!!hashCode READ UP!!!
